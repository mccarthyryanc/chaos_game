Chaos Game
==========

PyOpenGL implementaion of the Chaos Game. Right now you can choose: dimension, the number of the vertices, fraction ("step size" for each iteration), and max number of iterations. Currently only 1D and 2D is supported (I'm working on 3D) for dimension.

Example for 2D, with 3 vertices, a fraction of 0.5 and 5x10**5 interations:
$ ./main.py 2 3 0.5 500000

Here is a link to an animation where the fraction varies 0.0-1.0:
